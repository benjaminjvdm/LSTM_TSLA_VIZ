# Streamlit Application Development Plan

**Goal:** Create a Streamlit application with "Indicators" and "Machine Learning" tabs, using yfinance for data.

**Plan:**

1.  **Gather Information and Clarify Requirements:**
    *   Examine `inspiration.py` to understand its structure, UI elements, and functionality.

2.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Create a new Streamlit application file (e.g., `app.py`).
    *   Install necessary Python packages (streamlit, yfinance, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).

3.  **"Indicators" Tab Development:**
    *   Implement data fetching from yfinance.
    *   Create UI elements for selecting technical indicators.
    *   Calculate and visualize selected indicators including RSI, Stochastic Oscillator, and 50-day Moving Average using Matplotlib or Plotly.

4.  **"Machine Learning" Tab Development:**
    *   Implement data preprocessing and feature engineering.
    *   Create UI elements for selecting machine learning models (LSTM, SVM, and LightGBM).
    *   Train selected models on historical data.
    *   Evaluate model performance using chosen metrics.
    *   Present results in a clear and interpretable format.

5.  **UI/UX Enhancement:**
    *   Replicate the user-friendly interface of `inspiration.py`.
    *   Ensure intuitive navigation and clear presentation of results.

6.  **Testing and Refinement:**
    *   Thoroughly test the application with different data and model configurations.
    *   Refine the code and UI based on testing feedback.

7.  **Documentation:**
    *   Add comments to the code to explain the functionality.
    *   Create a README file with instructions on how to run the application.
